\begin{abstract}
	This report presents results of using authorship attribution methods on blog data.
	Blogs are regularly updated web pages, typically run by individuals, in an informational or conversational style.
	Scalability limitations of conventional methods were tested on selections of blogs from 50-150 authors from a publicly available dataset, and an ablative study on the extracted features was performed.
	The selections were constructed carefully as to not include authors with a low amount of blogs, or a low median blog length.
	Finally, the performance of a tree boosting classifier in combination with the conventional methods, inspired by top submissions in various Kaggle competitions, was tested to verify whether this can improve authorship attribution results.\vspace{12pt}
